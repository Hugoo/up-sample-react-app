DEMO: <https://hugoo.github.io/up-sample-react-app/>

This repo shows you how to use the LUKSO dev tools to interact with the LUKSO blockchain, smart contracts and standards.

It is built on top of:

- [`@lukso/lsp-factory.js`](https://docs.lukso.tech/tools/lsp-factoryjs/introduction/getting-started) to deploy and configure contracts
- [`@erc725/erc725.js`](https://docs.lukso.tech/tools/erc725js/getting-started) to read/fetch/decode ERC725 and LSP data
- [`@lukso/universalprofile-smart-contracts`](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-universalprofile-smart-contracts) to get smart contracts ABI

You can find the tutorial [here](https://docs.lukso.tech/tools/getting-started).
